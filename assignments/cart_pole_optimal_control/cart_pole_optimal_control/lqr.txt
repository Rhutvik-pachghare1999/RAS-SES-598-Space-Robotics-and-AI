The key functionality of the `CartPoleLQRController`:

- Cart-Pole System Modeling: The system dynamics are represented using linearized state-space equations with parameters like cart mass, pole mass, pole length, and gravitational acceleration.

- LQR Control: Implements a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to compute an optimal control force that stabilizes the pole in an upright position by minimizing a cost function related to the state and control effort.

- State Initialization & Perturbation: Introduces a small perturbation to the system's initial conditions to simulate instability and test the controller's ability to stabilize the system.

- State Estimation: The system state (cart position, velocity, pole angle, and pole angular velocity) is updated from incoming `JointState` messages from ROS 2.

- Control Loop: Runs a real-time control loop that calculates the control force based on the current state and applies the control force to the cart through the ROS 2 publisher.

- Data Logging: Logs the system's state and control force to a CSV file for analysis.

- ROS 2 Integration: Subscribes to `JointState` messages and publishes control commands to the appropriate topic for actuation.

- Force Clipping: The control force is clipped to a maximum value to prevent exceeding the system's capabilities.

- Time Management: The control loop operates with a fixed time step and limits the total simulation time.
